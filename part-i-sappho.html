        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p>The influence of Sappho on lesbian and queer history for well over two thousand years is undeniable and yet we can be sure of almost nothing about the woman herself and mostly fragments of her work survive. Alcaeus of Mytilene is the only potential contemporary of hers I could find. His works are also fragmented, but include a reference to Sappho that may be interpreted as having known her. Otherwise, we don’t hear from her again on the written page for two hundred years until Plato’s Phaedrus. <br> Although Sappho goes quiet for decades and centuries at a time, her imprint is still visible today. Perhaps more than ever with our current drive to write marginalized people back onto history’s pages. <br>This is intended to be an exploration of Sappho’s influence on queer literature through the ages. What impression can made of Sappho by peering through all the different interpretations of her poetry, the anthropological sleuthing of her life, and the legends of her lovers as seen through the artists she’s inspired? Ultimately, whatever can be pieced together during this read through history will be a fiction. Sappho will always be a legend larger than the life she actually lived and hopefully continue to be imagined and re-imagined for ages yet to come.
