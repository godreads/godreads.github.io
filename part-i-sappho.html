        <h1>part i: disciples of sappho</h1>
        <p><b>introduction, the isle of lesbos</b></p>
        <p>The influence of Sappho on lesbian and queer history for well over two thousand years is 
            undeniable. Her name and her home on Lesbos inspire the very language we use to describe women 
            who love women. And yet, we can be sure of almost nothing about the woman herself. Only 
            fragments of her work survive and we've relied on descriptions of her life by those who came
            after her. <br>Alcaeus of Mytilene is a potential contemporary of 
            hers. His works are also fragmented but include a reference to Sappho that 
            may be interpreted as having known her. But other than this scrap, we won’t hear of her again on the written 
            page until Plato’s Phaedrus, two hundred years later. <br>Although the thread of Sappho's disciples is often lost for decades 
            and centuries at a time it always comes back around. Most recently, Sappho has been helping to inspire movements 
            to write marginalized people back onto history’s pages. <br>My hope here is to explore Sappho's influence on queer literary history. What 
            impression can made of Sappho by peering through all the different interpretations of her 
            poetry, the anthropological sleuthing of her life, and the legends of her lovers as seen 
            through the artists she’s inspired? Ultimately, whatever can be pieced together during this 
            read through history will be a fiction. </p>
